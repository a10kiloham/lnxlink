## Welcome

Home Assistant companion app for linux that uses the MQTT integration to get info and control the PC.

## Features

* **Sensors:** Automatically discover sensors that monitor and control the system.
* **Home Assistant:** Uses MQTT Autodiscovery to create entities and shows if update is required.
* **No sudo required:** No need to be root user to install and use, unless used on server setup.
* **Easily expanded:** Any new module is automatically imported and custom modules can be added.

## Supported OS

Only Linux is supported and there is no plan on supporting Windows or MAC because it has many system dependencies that can't be ported. A recommended companion app for windows is [HASS.Agent](https://lab02-research.org/hassagent/).
